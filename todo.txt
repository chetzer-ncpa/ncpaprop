Modess:
Use sound speed calculation in SampledProfile, check for identity
Write explicit functions to allocate and free memory in SolveModNB, currently
	they are allocated in setParams() and freed in computeModes().  Probably
	should be allocated in constructor, freed in destructor, and a method provided
	to reset them.
Function to validate parameters
Descriptive variable names in getAbsorption() rather than meaningless arrays


AtmosphericProfile:
Create getMaxValidHeight() method
