NCPAPROP 1-D ATMOSPHERIC PROFILE
FILE FORMAT DESCRIPTION


The NCPA 1-D atmospheric file format described herein was designed to meet several
criteria combining readability and ease of use.  These criteria include:

* Remaining easy to read into programs in various languages
* To the extent practical, remaining human-readable
* Supporting an arbitrary number of vector and scalar properties
* Self-describing, particularly in terms of units
* Natively usable in Gnuplot

The file format consists of one or more header comment lines, which may be 
formatted (i.e. contain descriptive information) or unformatted (true
comments), followed by a series of columns of data representing the various
atmospheric properties contained in the profile.  Column 1 is assumed to be 
the independent altitude property, while all other columns are assumed to 
be the property value at that altitude.  Altitude of 0 is generally assumed to
be MSL.

Comment lines always begin with the '#' character.  Unformatted comments may
contain any characters after that with the exception of the '%' character,
which if found in the second character position indicates a formatted comment.
This allows all of the header lines to be easily ignored if desired, while
formatted, informative comments can also be easily identified and parsed.

Informative comment lines contain information describing vector and scalar
properties, and start with the characters '#%'.  Following that flag will
be 3 (for vector properties) or 4 (for scalar properties) comma- and/or 
space-separated fields.  The fields are:

Field 1: Column number, with the first column designated as column 1.  A
         column number of 0 indicates a scalar quantity (i.e. one that
         does not depend on altitude).
Field 2: The string "tag" that will be used to identify this property in
         the code.  The NCPA atmospheric library uses a string-mapping
         system that associates a data vector with a text string for
         identification.  In NCPAPROP, the following conventions are
         used:
         P - Atmospheric pressure
         RHO - Air density
         T - Temperature
         U - Zonal (west-to-east) wind speed
         V - Meridional (south-to-north) wind speed
         W - Vertical (ground-to-space) wind speed
         Z - Altitude above MSL
         Z0 - Ground altitude (scalar quantity, see below)
         Almost any other text strings may be specified for other 
         properties.  In general, ncpaprop calculations will require all 
         of the properties listed above except W (not used) and Z0 
         (assumed to be 0 if not present).  Tags beginning and ending with
         the underscore character '_' are reserved for internal use.
Field 3: A string representing the units in which the property is given.  The
		 following is a non-exhaustive list of recognized strings, which are
		 not case-sensitive:
		 "K", "DEGK", "DEG K", "DEGREES K"
		 "C", "DEGC", "DEG C", "DEGREES C"
		 "F", "DEGF", "DEG F", "DEGREES F"
		 "M", "METERS"
		 "KM", "KILOMETERS"
		 "M/S", "MPS", "MPERS", "M PER S", METERS PER SECOND"
		 "KM/S", "KMPS", "KMPERS", "KM PER S", "KILOMETERS PER SECOND"
		 "PA", "PASCAL", "PASCALS"
		 "MBAR", "MILLIBAR", "MILLIBARS"
		 "KG/M3", "KGPM3", "KILOGRAMS PER CUBIC METER"
		 "G/CM3", "GPCM3", "GRAMS PER CUBIC CENTIMETER"
		 "AZIMUTH", "DEG CW FROM N", "DEGREES CLOCKWISE FROM NORTH"
		 "DEG CCW FROM E"
		 "DEG", "DEGREES"
		 "RAD", "RADIANS"
Field 4: Property value (scalars only)

So, for example, in the canonical test profile provided in the file
NCPA_canonical_profile_zuvwtdp.dat, the following descriptive header
is given:

#% 0, Z0, m, 152.5
#% 1, Z, km
#% 2, U, m/s
#% 3, V, m/s
#% 4, W, m/s
#% 5, T, degK
#% 6, RHO, g/cm3
#% 7, P, mbar
